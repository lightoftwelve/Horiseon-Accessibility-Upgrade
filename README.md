# Horiseon Accessibility Upgrade

## Description
This project focuses on enhancing the accessibility standards of the Horiseon website to improve the site's SEO performance and readability for users who use screen readers. The HTML structure has been modified using semantic elements, the elements follow a logical structure, alt attributes have been added to images, headings are arranged in sequential order, and the title element is concise and descriptive.

## Installation
The project is hosted on a webpage, so there are no specific installation steps.

## Usage
When the HTML and CSS files are opened in a browser, the user will be presented with a clean, easy-to-read page. The navigation links correspond to the sections on the page, the images include alt text, and the CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized.

## Tests
Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and that the HTML and CSS have no errors.
